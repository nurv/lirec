  core only Java 1.5 (Java SE) is required.</p><p>A simple way to get started is to download and install the Eclipse
  plug-in - this will also require the Eclipse GEF framework to be installed
  (see below, if you don't have it installed already). This will provide you
  with all the dependencies you need to get going: you can simply create a new
  rule project and everything will be done for you. Refer to the chapter on
  the Rule Workbench and IDE for detailed instructions on this. Installing the
  Eclipse plug-in is generally as simple as unzipping a file into your Eclipse
  plug-in directory.</p><p>Use of the Eclipse plug-in is not required. Rule files are just
  textual input (or spreadsheets as the case may be) and the IDE (also known
  as the Rule Workbench) is just a convenience. People have integrated the
  rule engine in many ways, there is no "one size fits all".</p><p>Alternatively, you can download the binary distribution, and include
  the relevant jars in your projects classpath.</p><p/><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e1337"/>3.1.1. Dependencies and jars</h3></div></div></div><p>Drools is broken down into a few modules, some are required during
    rule development/compiling, and some are required at runtime. In many
    cases, people will simply want to include all the dependencies at runtime,
    and this is fine. It allows you to have the most flexibility. However,
    some may prefer to have their "runtime" stripped down to the bare minimum,
    as they will be deploying rules in binary form - this is also possible.
    The core runtime engine can be quite compact, and only require a few 100
    kilobytes across 2 jar files.</p><p>The following is a description of the important libraries that make
    up JBoss Rules</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>drools-api.jar - this provides the interfaces 
	and factories. Drools-api also helps clearly show what is intended 
	as a user api and what is just an engine api.</p></li><li><p>drools-core.jar - this is the core engine, runtime component.
        Contains both the RETE engine and the LEAPS engine. This is the only
        runtime dependency if you are pre-compiling rules (and deploying via
        Package or RuleBase objects).</p></li><li><p>drools-compiler.jar - this contains the compiler/builder
        components to take rule source, and build executable rule bases. This
        is often a runtime dependency of your application, but it need not be
        if you are pre-compiling your rules. This depends on
        drools-core</p></li><li><p>drools-jsr94.jar - this is the JSR-94 compliant implementation,
        this is essentially a layer over the drools-compiler component. Note
        that due to the nature of the JSR-94 specification, not all features
        are easily exposed via this interface. In some cases, it will be
        easier to go direct to the Drools API, but in some environments the
        JSR-94 is mandated.</p></li><li><p>drools-decisiontables.jar - this is the decision tables
        'compiler' component, which uses the drools-compiler component. This
        supports both excel and CSV input formats.</p></li></ul></div><p>There are quite a few other dependencies which the above components
    require, most of which are for the drools-compiler, drools-jsr94 or
    drools-decisiontables module. Some key ones to
    note are "POI" which provides the
    spreadsheet parsing ability, and "antlr" which provides the parsing for
    the rule language itself.</p><p>NOTE: if you are using Drools in J2EE or servlet containers and you
    come across classpath issues with "JDT", then you can switch to the janino
    compiler. Set the system property "drools.compiler": For example:
    -Ddrools.compiler=JANINO.</p><p>For up to date info on dependencies in a release, consult the
    README_DEPENDENCIES.txt file, which can be found in the lib directory of
    the download bundle, or in the root of the project directory.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e1366"/>3.1.2. Runtime</h3></div></div></div><p>The "runtime" requirements mentioned here are if you are deploying
    rules as their binary form (either as KnowledgePackage objects, or KnowledgeBase objects
    etc). This is an optional feature that allows you to keep your runtime
    very light. You may use drools-compiler to produce rule packages "out of
    process", and then deploy them to a runtime system. This runtime system
    only requires drools-core.jar and drools-api for execution. This is an optional
    deployment pattern, and many people do not need to "trim" their
    application this much, but it is an ideal option for certain
    environments.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e1371"/>3.1.3. Installing IDE (Rule Workbench)</h3></div></div></div><p>The rule workbench (for Eclipse) requires that you have Eclipse 3.4
    or greater, as well as Eclipse GEF 3.4 or greater. You can install it
    either by downloading the plug-in or, or using the update site.</p><p>Another option is to use the JBoss IDE, which comes with all the
    plug-in requirements pre packaged, as well as a choice of other tools
    separate to rules. You can choose just to install rules from the "bundle"
    that JBoss IDE ships with.</p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e1378"/>3.1.3.1. Installing GEF (a required dependency)</h4></div></div></div><p>GEF is the Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework, which is used for
      graph viewing components in the plug-in.</p><p>If you don't have GEF installed, you can install it using the
      built in update mechanism (or downloading GEF from the Eclipse.org
      website not recommended). JBoss IDE has GEF already, as do many other "distributions" of
      Eclipse, so this step may be redundant for some people.</p><p>Open the Help-&gt;Software updates...-&gt;Available Software-&gt;Add Site...

      may be required). Once this is completed, then you can continue on

    Click the 'Open Perspective' button in the top right corner of your Eclipse window,
    select 'Other...' and pick the Drools perspective.  If you cannot find the Drools perspective
    as one of the possible perspectives, the installation probably was unsuccessful. Check
    whether you executed each of the required steps correctly: Do you have the right version
    of Eclipse (3.4.x)?  Do you have Eclipse GEF installed (check whether the org.eclipse.gef_3.4.*.jar
    exists in the plugins directory in your eclipse root folder)? Did you extract the Drools Eclipse
    plugin correctly (check whether the org.drools.eclipse_*.jar exists in the plugins directory in
    your eclipse root folder)?  If you cannot find the problem, try contacting us (e.g. on irc or on
    the user mailing list), more info can be found no our homepage here:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://www.jboss.org/drools/">http://www.jboss.org/drools/</a></p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e1415"/>3.1.3.4. Drools Runtimes</h4></div></div></div><p>A Drools runtime is a collection of jars on your file system that represent
    one specific release of the Drools project jars. To create a runtime, you must 
    point the IDE to the release of your choice.  If you want to create a new runtime
    based on the latest Drools project jars included in the plugin itself, you can also
    easily do that.  You are required to specify a default Drools runtime for your
    Eclipse workspace, but each individual project can override the default and select
    the appropriate runtime for that project specifically.</p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="d0e1420"/>3.1.3.4.1. Defining a Drools runtime</h5></div></div></div><p>You are required to define one or more Drools runtimes using the Eclipse preferences
      view.  To open up your preferences, in the menu Window select the Preferences
      menu item.  A new preferences dialog should show all your preferences.  On the
      left side of this dialog, under the Drools category, select "Installed Drools
      runtimes".  The panel on the right should then show the currently defined Drools
      runtimes.  If you have not yet defined any runtimes, it should like something like
      the figure below.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Chapter-Install/drools-runtimes.png" align="middle"/></div><p>To define a new Drools runtime, click on the add button.  A dialog as shown
      below should pop up, requiring the name for your runtime and the location on your
      file system where it can be found.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Chapter-Install/drools-runtimes-add.png" align="middle"/></div><p>In general, you have two options:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>If you simply want to use the default jars as included in the Drools
        Eclipse plugin, you can create a new Drools runtime automatically by clicking the
        "Create a new Drools 5 runtime ..." button.  A file browser will show up, asking
        you to select the folder on your file system where you want this runtime to be
        created.  The plugin will then automatically copy all required dependencies to
        the specified folder.  After selecting this folder, the dialog should look like
        the figure shown below.</p></li><li><p>If you want to use one specific release of the Drools project, you should
        create a folder on your file system that contains all the necessary Drools libraries
        and dependencies.  Instead of creating a new Drools runtime as explained above, give
        your runtime a name and select the location of this folder containing all the required
        jars.</p></li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Chapter-Install/drools-runtimes-add2.png" align="middle"/></div><p>After clicking the OK button, the runtime should show up in your table of installed
      Drools runtimes, as shown below.  Click on checkbox in front of the newly created runtime 
      to make it the default Drools runtime.  The default Drools runtime will be used as the
      runtime of all your Drools project that have not selected a project-specific runtime.
      </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Chapter-Install/drools-runtimes2.png" align="middle"/></div><p>You can add as many Drools runtimes as you need.  For example, the screenshot below
      shows a configuration where three runtimes have been defined: a Drools 4.0.7 runtime, a
      Drools 5.0.0 runtime and a Drools 5.0.0.SNAPSHOT runtime.  The Drools 5.0.0 runtime is
      selected as the default one.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Chapter-Install/drools-runtimes3.png" align="middle"/></div><p>Note that you will need to restart Eclipse if you changed the default runtime and
      you want to make sure that all the projects that are using the default runtime update
      their classpath accordingly.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="d0e1457"/>3.1.3.4.2. Selecting a runtime for your Drools project</h5></div></div></div><p>Whenever you create a Drools project (using the New Drools Project wizard or by
      converting an existing Java project to a Drools project using the "Convert to Drools

      an existing Java project), the plugin will automatically add all the required jars to
      the classpath of your project.</p><p>When creating a new Drools project, the plugin will automatically use the default
      Drools runtime for that project, unless you specify a project-specific one.  You can do
      this in the final step of the New Drools Project wizard, as shown below, by deselecting
      the "Use default Drools runtime" checkbox and selecting the appropriate runtime in the
      drop-down box.  If you click the "Configure workspace settings ..." link, the workspace
      preferences showing the currently installed Drools runtimes will be opened, so you can

    the source. Since version 3.1 Drools uses Maven 2 to build the system. There are two profiles
    available which enable the associated modules "documentation" and
    "Eclipse"; this enables quicker building of the core modules for
    developers. The Eclipse profile will download Eclipse into the
    drools-Eclipse folder, which is over 100MB download (It depends on your operating system), however this only
    needs to be done once; if you wish you can move that Eclipse download into
    another location and specify it with
    -DlocalEclipseDrop=/folder/jboss-drools/local-Eclipse-drop-mirror. The
    following builds all the jars, the documentation and the Eclipse zip with
    a local folder specified to avoid downloading Eclipse:</p><pre class="programlisting">mvn -Declipse -Ddocumentation clean install -DlocalEclipseDrop=/folder/jboss-drools/local-Eclipse-drop-mirror </pre><p>You can produce distribution builds, which puts everything into
    zips, as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">mvn -Declipse -Ddocumentation clean install -DlocalEclipseDrop=/folder/jboss-drools/local-Eclipse-drop-mirror
mvn -Ddocumentation -Declipse -Dmaven.test.skip package javadoc:javadoc assembly:assembly -DlocalEclipseDrop=/folder/jboss-drools/local-Eclipse-drop-mirror
</pre><p>Note that install must be done first as javadoc:javadoc won't work
    unless the jars are in the local maven repo, but the tests can be skipped
    on the second run. assembly:assembly fails unless you increase the
    available memory to Maven, on windows the following command worked well:
    set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m</p><p>Type mvn clean to clear old artifacts, and then test and built the
    source, and report on any errors.</p><p>The resulting jars are put in the /target directory from the top
    level of the project.</p><p>As maven builds each module it will install the resulting jars in
    the local Maven 2 repository automatically. Where it can be easily used
    from other project <code class="literal">pom.xml</code> or copied else where.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/Chapter-Install/mvn_install4.png"/></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e1615"/>3.4.2. Building the Manual</h3></div></div></div><p>
		The building of the manual is now integrated into the maven build process, and is built by either using the profile (-Ddocumentation) switch or 
		cding into the main directory.
	</p><p>Drools uses <a id="d0e1622" class="indexterm"/>Docbook for this manual. Maven is used to build documents and this build produces three different formats, 
      all sharing the same images directory.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>html_single</p><p>The entire manual in a single html document</p></li><li><p><a id="d0e1634" class="indexterm"/>html</p><p>The manual is split into multiple documents and placed in a
        frameset. The left frame provides navigation</p></li><li><p>Eclipse</p><p>Documentation suitable for including in an Eclipse plug-in</p></li></ul></div><p>The manual can be generated from the project pom.xml by
    calling <code class="literal">'mvn package'</code> in the drools-docs directory or adding the -Ddocumentation switch when you build the sources.
    Documentation is generated into each drools-docs subdirectory's <code class="literal">'target/'</code> directory. Running <code class="literal">'mvn -Ddocumentation package assembly:assembly'</code>
    in the Drools project root generates and copies the documentation into a zip file. This zip file is located in the root folders <code class="literal">'target/'</code>
    directory.
